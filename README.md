# Vehicle Detection and Counting System for Two Way Road
This project focuses on detecting, tracking and counting vehicles by using "[Blob Detection](http://www.learnopencv.com/blob-detection-using-opencv-python-c/)" method. The unique ID is assigned to the each vehicle so it can not be counted more than once. This project was developed with OpenCV library (**[version 2.4.10](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.10/)**).
